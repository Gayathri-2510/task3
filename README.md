#Web Scraper Application
# News Headlines Web Scraper

This Python script fetches top news headlines from a specified news website using requests and BeautifulSoup.  
It extracts headline texts and saves them into a `headlines.txt` file for easy access.  
Ensure you have installed the required libraries (`requests`, `beautifulsoup4`) before running the script.  
Respect the target website's terms of service and robots.txt when scraping data.
